# j-stew.github.io

Steps:
1. Started with this tutorial https://4bes.nl/2021/08/29/create-a-website-with-hugo-and-github-pages/
2. `publishdir` doesn't output files to `docs` so manually renamed `public`
3. Need to update `localhost` to github.io URL when building so the assets (e.g. CSS, JS) have correct domain
