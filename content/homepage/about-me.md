##### Professionel Experience

I started my career building microservices in a containerized environment (beta tester for AWS Elastic Container Service) with a messaging architecture that communicates with a monolith. Ready for a challenge (and scale!) I moved onto a low-latency dynamic pricing system that honed skills in observability, monitoring, profiling and load testing. An interest in big data and machine learning took me to data platform and infrastructure where I realized my passion for building in the cloud with infrastructure-as-code. 

Now I work across stateless and stateful infrastructure leveraging experience from each phase of my career. I enjoy building resilient and secure systems that make an impact.
